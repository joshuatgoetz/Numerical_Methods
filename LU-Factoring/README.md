This function will calculate the LU decomposition for a given square
    matrix, including the upper and lower triangular matrixes as well as
    the pivot matrix.
    If an insufficient input is given, an accordant error message will be
    displayed.
    
    Inputs:
       A - coefficient matrix
    Outputs:
       L - lower triangular matrix
       U - upper triangular matrix
       P - the pivot matrix
