# Numerical_Methods

The Numerical Methods repository is one which contains each of the algorithms I made for the Spring 2019 session of MECH 105 which
can be used for root finding, integral approximation, and the decomposition of linear matricies.

Additional details about each specific algorithm can be found in it's specified README file.
